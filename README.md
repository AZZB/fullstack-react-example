# react fullstack example

I built this example because I was struggling on how to integrate all the react redux ecosystem libs

this example use:
  * redux
  * react router v4
  * redux saga
  * redux form
  * immutablejs
  * reselect
  * semantic ui

for the backend I'm using [elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) [phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/)

## Learn more
the root level files is for the backend framework (mainly a json api), for the react redux stuff checkout [web/static](web/static) folder

the code needs some refactoring, do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or you need some clarification
